	<p>So, where were we, ha, we were talking about my second favorite food after <b>pasta</b><br>
		I love <b>Pizza</b><br>
		It has so many topping and styles I love<br>
		Even though it is a <i>italian</i>, many countries have developed it in their own way like the pepparoni Pizza from the <b>US</b><br>
		My favorite variety of <b><u>Pizza</u></b> is the <b>Margarita</b>, even though it is very plain with just cheese and tomato sauce it still has the spice that I cannot explain about yet<br>
		There are still some topping I do not like frm pizza including <b>Olives, Tomato, Capsicum</b><br>
		Well I really hope you liked about my website about <b>Pizza</b><br>
